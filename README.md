# Portfolio-Launch-Page
## Description
This project aims to create and maintain a live webpage to provide potential employers with access to samples of my work and projects, as well as provide my contact information and background in a clean and professional format utilizing semantic HTML elements for accessibility and CSS styling techniques for a more interactive experience.

## Current Stage
For now, the About Me and My Work sections of the page contain placeholder text, images and links.
Ongoing plans:
- Replace placeholder text in About Me
- Replace My Work placeholders with screenshots and text matching projects completed and in portfolio
- Update links in My Work segments to go to project GitHub repositories and deployed projects when clicked

## Deployment
To view the deployed and current project: https://accoon.github.io/Portfolio-Launch-Page/

## Usage
Navigation links at the top of the page will scroll you to the relevant section, and Resumé will link to a PDF of current resumé.
